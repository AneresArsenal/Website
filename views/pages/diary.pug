      | [ Dart and Flutter ]

    p.diary 
      | This is my first exposure to mobile development. 
      | Initially it was a huge learning curve given that the framework 
      | used to develop mobile applications is slightly different from web 
      | of software applications. I got to work on some challenging projects such 
      | as building a business card / resume and mobile app and an instagram-like | social media mobile application.

      | [ Javascript ]

    p.diary 
      | This course provides an introduction to the "front-end" of software 
      | engineering lifecycle implementation namely in topics such as 
      | requirements analysis and specification, design techniques
      | and project management. We worked in a team of six on two projects, 
      | one implemented using AGILE and the other using Waterfall. It was great
      | exposure to experiencing differences between the two methodologies, 
      | their strengths and weaknesses and how one may be better suited in 
      | specific development requirements and needs than the other. Written in C.

      | [ C and Python ]

    p.diary 
      | Algorithms! As many put it, it is a pivotal building blocks in one's knowledge in 
      | software development and computer science. It was certainly not the easiest course
      | as there were many concepts to grasp such as recurrence relations and recursive algorithms
      | but I did enjoy learning about their importance and how they can be useful in 
      | software engineering. We explored further on the topic of Big-O complexity and different 
      | types of algorithms that are widely used in software development. 

    h3.diary CS340 Introduction to Databases &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      | [ JavaScript, NodeJS , SQL]

    p.diary 
      | Being a logical thinker and a data enthusiast, I really enjoyed this course as I got to learn how to use
      | SQL to create queries to interact with databases. I was exposed to best practices on how to design and implement  
      | relational databases which includes topics on data modeling with Entity Relationship Model and Unified Modeling language,
      | designing relational schema and diagrams, relational algebra, user interfaces, and administration. The course included 
      | a group project. My teammate and I successfully implemented and deployed a web application that enable users to interact.

    h3.diary CS271 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-
      | &nbsp;&nbsp;
      | [ Assembly ]

    p.diary 
      | This is probably one of the hardest courses I have taken in the program so far mostly due to
      | the fact that we need to complete our assignments using a low-level language (assembly).
      | Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the functional organization and operation of computers.
      | I also learned how to perform addressing, using stacks, argument passing, arithmetic operations,
      | macros, modularization with assembly. Bonus point: As I have a Macbook, I learned how to create 
      | a virtual machine on my laptop to enable me to use Windows OS for this course! :)

    h3.diary CS261 Data Structures &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-
      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      | [ C ]

    p.diary 
      | I learned about the different data structures and several software
      | topics such as time complexity analysis, vectors, lists, queues, trees, heaps, 
      | hash tables maps, and graphs. I discovered how utlizing different data structures
      | dictates the efficiency of accessing, adding, searching and deleting items from the
      | data structures. We used C when exploring the different data structures.

      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      | [ C++ ]

    p.diary 
      | Building on from CS161, we dived deeper into more complex topics which includes data structures, 
      | programming techniques and application of software engineering principles. Using C++ as
      | well in this course, we learned to use classes, structures, inheritance and polymorphism
      | to create more efficient programs. Furthermore, I developed software development testing plans
      | to run tests to ensure our programs function as expected. This trained myself to think critically
      | about how my program functions and if it satisfy the objectives and criterias that are established
      | for the program.

    h3.diary CS161 Introduction to Computer Science I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+
      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      | [ C++ ]

    p.diary 
      | This is the first programming course I took. The language used for this course
      | was C++. The course provided an overview of fundamental concepts of computer science which
      | included aspects of problem solving in computer science, software engineering
      | as well and object-oriented programming. We learned algorithm design, 
      | program development, recursive definitions and graph theory. It was what I would call
      | the perfect "initiation" into programming. Tough but essential, learning to deal with 
      | memory allocation and management as well as ensuring the right data types are used was helpful
      | in establishing discipline in my software development practices. It helped trained my mind to 
      | visualize the flow of data within a program to avoid memory leaks and ensuring appropriate usage 
      | of variables and data structures.

    h3.diary CS225 Discrete Structures in Computer Science &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A

    p.diary 
      | The course covered fundemental discrete mathematics of 
      | computer science which includes topics such as logic, set and set operations, methods of proof, 
      | recursive definitions and graph theory. Despite it not being a favourite amongst the students,
      | I personally enjoyed learning the logic and proofing methods as math has always been a favourite
      | subject of mine in academia. After progressing through the program, I realized that the logic and proofing exercises
      | covered in this course has been tremendously helpful in training my mind to think in a logical way
      | when creating for, while, if else loops as well as understanding recursions.
