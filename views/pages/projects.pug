     | As I am nearing the end of my computer science program at OSU, I am excited and grateful to gain
     | tremendous exposure to various topics ranging from database to cloud development.
     | Equipped with this knowledge, I felt drawn to the notion of applying it in an
     | application that came into my mind recently. Without ruining the surprise 
     | as it is in its early stages of design and development, I am hoping to share my project
     | milestones here in the future. Stay tuned!

     | Currently, I am in the process of assessing the project's viability by conducting various
     | analysis such as an environmental scan, a SWOT analysis and interviews with stakeholders
     | within the product's market. This is crucial to understand users' needs and wants to
     | ensure my application is able to help them attain those objectives.
