     | To fulfill our graduation requirements, I am tasked to work with two
     | other coursemates and collaborate on a group project. 
     | Our team have decided to expand our exposure in cloud development 
     | by deploying our project on AWS Elastic Beanstalk platform. We also 
     | implemented a simple CI/CD process by using AWS's CodePipeline technology,
     | integrating our application with a GitHub respository. Furthermore, we 
     | practiced the AGILE methodology and coordinated our tasks in weekly sprints
     | with the use of JIRA. Application written in Python, Javascript, Flask with 
     | the use of AWS EC2, DynamoDB, JQuery and Bootstrap 4.

    p.projects 
     | As I am nearing the end of my computer science program at OSU, I am excited 
     | and grateful to gain tremendous exposure to various facets of software
     | development ranging from designing database to cloud development.
     | Equipped with this knowledge, I am working on leveraging my skill sets to
     | create a fun social media app. Without ruining the surprise as it is in 
     | its early stages of design and development, I am hoping to share my project
     | milestones here in the future. Stay tuned!

        .col-5 Spring 2018

    p.projects 
     | Being an avid user of mobile application given its accessibility, this 
     | was one of the courses that I was looking forward most to in this program!
     | I must admit the learning curve was as steep as it was exciting given the
     | conceptually I never worked with state management. However, I am glad
     | I took this course because despite it being one of the most challenging
     | course conceptual, I realized in hindsight it was a terrific prep
     | for learning ReactJS (which I am doing now). Android applications are 
     | written in Flutter and Dart.

     | I have started developing my personal website since 2018. Since then, it has seen a 
     | significant change in design and functionalities as my knowledge in web development improved.
     | This website functions as my personal testing lab as I seek to explore different UX design to 
     | create a welcoming, minimalistic and chic website that people would enjoy exploring!
